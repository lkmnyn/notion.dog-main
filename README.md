Star This Repo !  😉 😉

### Step 2 -  Choose your subdomain 💡
Now determine your notion.dog subdomain: either choose your username or the name according to your Notion website (for example, either ```foo.notion.dog``` or ```bar.notion.dog``` would be possible).

### Step 3 -  [IMPORTANT] Add a JSON data file to this repo  📌
🏮 Add a JSON data file named ```[your-subdomain].json``` into the [```your.notion.dog``` folder](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/tree/main/your.notion.dog) of this repo.
> examples:
- [juliana.json](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/juliana.json "juliana.json")  (single page website https://juliana.notion.dog)  
- [amyrogers.json ](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/amyrogers.json "amyrogers.json ") (mulitple pages website with Pretty URL https://amyrogers.notion.dog).

 💡 When your JSON file is named` foo.json`,  the finally URL would be `https://foo.notion.dog`.

✏️  **Configue everything in your JSON file**, such as home page, URL slugs,custom google fonts, custom javascript code, page title, meta description and more. Please refer to the demo file [amyrogers.json ](https://github.com/notiondog/notion.dog/blob/main/your.notion.dog/amyrogers.json "amyrogers.json ") to figure out how to get it done , it's easy to understand.  😉

📌 **IMPORTANT: please  make sure your JSON file is valid and correct in JSON syntax before you move forward!** A [JSON Checker](https://jsonchecker.com/ "JSON Checker") would be help.

Your website should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict or a incorrect JSON syntax).
